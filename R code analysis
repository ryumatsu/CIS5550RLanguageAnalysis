##Interpretation of Visualizations 

##These visualizations will clearly show: 

##Instant Bookable Status: Non-instant bookings lead to higher positive review rates. 

##Minimum Nights Requirement: Shorter stays have a slight advantage in positive review rates. 

##Value Perception: High-value listings have a much higher positive review rate, illustrating that perceived value strongly influences guest satisfaction. 

##These visualizations will help to visually reinforce that perceived value is the most significant factor in positive feedback, with booking flexibility also playing a role.
